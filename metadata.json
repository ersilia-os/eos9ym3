    "Description": [
        "The authors use a two-step approach to build a model that accurately predicts the lipophilicity (LogP) of small molecules. First, they train the model on a large amount of low accuracy predicted LogP values and then they fine-tune the network using a small, accurate dataset of 244 druglike compounds. The model achieves an average root mean squared error of 0.988 and 0.715 against druglike molecules from Reaxys and PHYSPROP."
